### In Memory of Sheryl Azzam

This is the source code for the memorial website, created in 
honor of Sheryl Azzam's life. It aims to summarize, through 
family favorite photos, and archives of her art work, creative 
writings, recipes, and more.

#### The Design - Christian Azzam
I did my best to style the website with Mom in mind.

- The chosen background is meant look like the hard cover of a book
- The red tabs (indicating the current page) is meant to look like bookmarks
- The cardinal (purchased from an artist on etsy) represents Mom's love for 
bird's, as well as wildlife in general. It was made transparent to appear as if
it is stacked into the hard cover
